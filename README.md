💧 Water Quality Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the quality of water using data science techniques. Clean and safe water is essential for human health, and this analysis explores how different chemical properties affect water safety. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and machine learning modeling to classify water as potable (safe to drink) or not potable.

📖 Overview

The notebook project.ipynb walks through the entire workflow:

📂 Importing and understanding the dataset (water_potability.csv)

🧹 Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling features)

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

🤖 Building and training machine learning models

📈 Evaluating model performance

🔮 Predicting water quality
